JSONPlaceholder Proxy API Demo
This project demonstrates a simple ASP.NET Core Web API controller acting as a proxy for interacting with JSONPlaceholder's posts data.

Functionality

GET /api/Post/GetPostById/{id} - Retrieves a specific post by its ID
POST /api/Post/CreatePost - Creates a new post (note: JSONPlaceholder might not fully support this)
PUT /api/Post/EditExistingPost/{id} - Updates an existing post by ID (note: JSONPlaceholder might not fully support this)
DELETE /api/Post/DeletePost/{id} - Deletes a post by ID (note: JSONPlaceholder might not fully support this)
GET /api/Post/GetAllPost - Fetches a list of all posts
Prerequisites

.NET Core (Version might be needed)
ASP.NET Core Web API project
Setup

Clone this repository.
Open the project in your IDE or code editor.
Run the web application.
Usage (Example)

Replace localhost:5000 (or the relevant port) with the base URL where your application is running:

GET http://localhost:5000/api/Post/GetPostById/1 
Important Notes

This project utilizes JSONPlaceholder (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) as a stand-in for a real data source.
JSONPlaceholder's API might have limitations or lack full support for certain CRUD operations.
This code primarily serves as a demonstration of creating a proxy-style Web API controller in ASP.NET Core.
Dependencies

Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http
Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc
Newtonsoft.Json
System.Net.Http
Future Development

Replace JSONPlaceholder with a dedicated API designed for the intended data type (e.g., an actual employee management API).
Implement error handling and logging for a production-ready environment.
Consider adding authentication/authorization mechanisms if working with sensitive data.
